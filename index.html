      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>We have seen in recent times that simple tweets by some known people
      have caused heavy disruptions in the Cryptocurrency market. This poses a
      natural question that whether the general perception of such securities
      on the digital market affect the market in real-time or not?</p>

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <h3>Google trends</h3>
      <p>Google accounts for approximately 3/4th of the internet searches. This
      search is a useful indicator of what the people are interested in or what
      are their interests in particular topics? Google publishes all this
      information via Google trends. Moreover, this data can also be used to
      understand the evolution of public perception about various topics over
      time. </p>

      <h3>Kaggle</h3>
      <p>Open, high, low, close, and adj close prices along with traded volume
      since 17 Sept 2014 till last week from kaggle.</p>

      <h3>Tweets</h3>
      <p>A lot of people express their opinions on social media which paints
      quite a realistic picture of public perception. Gaining insights into
      public perception using social media platforms is an emerging tool in
      data science. Twint is the python library available for these activities.

          <p><b>Shortcomings</b></p>

          <ul>
            <li> The data set is very small.</li>
            <li> Unnecessary objective tweets by promotional channels leading
              to an overwhelmingly positive data set. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>


      <h2>Goal</h2>

      <p>We wish to accomplish sentiment analysis using google trends, Twitter,
      and price history data.</p>

      <p>An ambitious task would be to implement the LSTM neural network as
      well. </p>

      <p>We would also like to develop a filtering mechanism to filter out the
      objective tweets to improve the model.</p>
      <h2>Plan</h2>
      <p>Current plan and work distribution is shown in this illustration by
      Kajori.</p>
